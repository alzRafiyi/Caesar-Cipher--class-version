# Case-Study-05-Caesar-Cipher-class-version-

A **cipher** is an algorithm (a secret code) for performing encryption (and the reverse, decryption). The idea of the **Caesar Cipher** is to pick an integer and shift every letter of your message by that integer. 

In this case study, we will explore a cipher that is reported by contemporary Greek historians to have been used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to generals during times of war. We write a `Message` class and two other subclasses to implement the **Caesar Cipher**.
